- We design like machines
- In modern screen-based design, everything looks the same.
- techniques and trends like responsive design, flat design
- "The practice of design involves a whole new mountain of influence crunching down, strong arming decisions, imposing standards, and questioning abilities."
    1. "Metrics-obsessed pseudo-science"
    2. "Copycat culture"
    3. "Crap content selling crap"
- We design like machines
- Content is being conformed to corporate templates -- Squarespace, The Grid, Medium, et al.
- Editorial design
    - “how do magazines achieve rich reactions and connections, and how do we translate those approaches to the screen?”
    - "Unlike the web, editorial systems are designed for variation, not prescription. They are a starting point, not a final deliverable."
    - __Content drives design and design augments the content.__
    - "Let’s destroy the arbitrary division between UX and visual design, let’s pull research away from our own reality distortion fields, and let’s give our content more responsibility."
