          I am a certified teacher of Computer Sciences, Histories, Geography,
          and Academic Research. As teacher and counselor, I have prepared
          hundreds of students for academic life abroad, culminating in being
          appointed leader of the AP Computer Sciences program and AP Capstone
          research program, an intensive academic research course and one of the
          first such programs introduced in China. I'm an expert on computer
          program modeling, active learning techniques, and inquiry-based
          learning through primary source documents.
