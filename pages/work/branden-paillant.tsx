        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The client, a gifted up-and-coming photographer of urban landscapes,
            had little online presence outside of Instagram.
          </li>
          <li>
            An online store to sell prints needed to be built from scratch or
            use commercial APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The client's work is scheduled to be featured in Hartsfield-Jackson
            Atlanta International Airport. Therefore a responsively-designed
            photo gallery would be needed for both through-travelers that would
            look him up on their mobile phones as well as other visitors that
            would be using larger screens to view high resolution versions of
            his works.
          </li>
          <li>
            An photo gallery should exhibit the artist's work elegantly without
            coming off as overly commercial; The design and functionality should
            not detract from the work, preserving and highlighting the artist's
            trademark{' '}

        <h2>Impact</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Helped the client save over $500 a year, eliminating a large cost
            hurdle to starting his business and promoting his works.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Set up an account for the client as a{' '}
            <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners">Shopify Partner</a>, then
            leveraged Shopifyâ€™s GraphQL API to build a website.
          </li>
          <li>
            This allowed the client to eliminate Shopify's online store
            altogether and use the cheapest pricing tier. The client paid less
            than 1/3 of the service fees had he used Shopify's full-featured
            service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Utilizing Shopify's CDN for static assets allowed the client to
            eliminate any additional costs besides the minimal hosting of the
            source code.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <strong>
            Developed and deployed a fast, performant, static photo gallery.
          </strong>

          <li>
            Deployed Next.js static export builds to provide fast user
            experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set up continuous integration processes using webhooks, pushing
            deployments automatically upon the client's modifications to the
            Shopify backend. This removed the need for me to push updates
            manually when changes are made to the product database and preserved
            the fast, ultralight speed of a static website.

            I felt the author's trademark aesthetic (described as "deadpan," a
            cool, detached, and unemotional presentation of a subject) could
            best be presented in a minimalist design absent of lines, buttons,
            graphics, and other common baubles.
