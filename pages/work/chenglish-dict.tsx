          As any learner of Chinese soon discovers, there are <i>a lot</i> of
          characters to learn.{' '}
          <a href="https://lingua.mtsu.edu/academic/dajun-4thtech.pdf">
            A 2004 study conducted by Jun Da
          </a>
          , a linguist at Middle Tennessee State University, found that there
          are an astounding 258,852,642 unique Chinese characters in use in
          classical and modern texts. Luckily for learners of the modern
          language, only about 8,000 are generally known by fluent speakers;
          Even better, Jun estimates only 3,500 characters are commonly used in
          modern texts like newspapers and novels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, the path to literacy in Chinese is a daunting task. As I myself
          discovered, learning 3,500 characters is time-consuming and
          nerve-wracking, especially after your weary eyes have come across that
          same character a hundred times and you still can&apos;t seem to get it
          saved in your memory bank.
        </p>

          But the benefits of overcoming this hurdle and achieving bilingualism
          are huge, impacting life span and personal wealth. A landmark study
          published in the journal <i>Neurology</i> in 2013 found that{' '}

          . In 2014, The Economist used economic studies and the principle of
          compound interest to argue that{' '}
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2014/03/11/johnson-what-is-a-foreign-language-worth">
            learning a second language can potentially add $128,000 to your
            retirement account
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          As I tell my students, to effectively learn anything requires
          consistent practice (a little every day), and an efficient way to
          repetitively expose the brain to new information in a curtailing
          frequency (in other words, see something less frequently as that
          information is more concretely retained to memory). In my classroom we
          do this using{' '}
          <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/">
            Cornell Notes
          </a>{' '}
          and <a href="http://quizlet.com">Quizlet</a>. For my AP US History
          students, I created{' '}
          <a href="https://quizlet.com/mrberti/folders/ap-us-history?x=1xqt&i=s1e72">
            Quizlet study sets
          </a>{' '}
          for every learning module in the course. Student feedback consistently
          rates these flash card sets as the most helpful tool available for
          learning (almost always above my painstakingly-prepared lectures).
        </p>
        <p>
          So given what we know about effective learning, I was dismayed to
          discover that when I set out to learn those 3,500 Chinese characters,
          there wasn&apos;t much available for me to really learn efficiently.
          Thereafter I built this web app on top of{' '}
          <a href="https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php">the data</a> that
          powers my favorite Chinese-English Dictionary,{' '}
          <a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary">
            MDBG Chinese Dictionary
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by converting all 91,678 entries of the CC-CEDICT dictionary
          into MySQL data. I then built{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/chenglish-dictionary/tree/master/src">
            three PHP class objects
          </a>{' '}
          to manage the data:

              Zhongwen class
            </a>{' '}
            to fetch the data

          <li>
            A{' '}

            to manage and render personal vocabulary lists compiled by users
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The class objects are all covered by{' '}

          </a>
          , which were written in conjunction with the classes themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the front end, I designed the app to be mobile-first since I mostly
          practice using my phone. The{' '}
