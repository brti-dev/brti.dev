        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          This app was designed with the general goal of being a place for
          gamers to read and contribute information about their favorite games.
          Because the app was highly dependent on user-generated content, the
          interfaces had to be easy to use and understand. The result of the
          user's contribution must be immediate and visually appealing, so I
          configured a CMS that was open to all registered users but was
          manageable by administrators.
        </p>

        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>
          Built using JavaScript and jQuery for interfaces and asynchronous
          requests, on top of PHP and MySQL.
        </p>

          One of the primary features is the videogame shelf for users to manage
          and show off their collection of games. Because the purpose is to show
          off swag, the shelf had to be elegant to maximize boastfulness. I used
          Photoshop to make custom jewel case overlays -- transparent PNGs --
          for different platforms.

          The landing page to a user profile shows a stream of activity
          organized chronologically. There are also various badges users can
          earn. These are meant to stimulate activity and contributions.
