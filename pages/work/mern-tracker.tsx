          I previously started to learn React and wanted to enhance my
          understanding of it while learning other modern frameworks. I used
          Subramanian&#39;s{' '}
          <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484243909">
            &quot;Pro MERN Stack&quot;
          </a>{' '}
          as a primary reference, but also consulted other sources to make the
          modifications I desired. Essential sources include{' '}
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">
            React Hooks documentation
          </a>
          ,{' '}
          <a href="https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start">
            React Router documentation
          </a>
          ,{' '}
          <a href="https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/">
            Material UI documentation
          </a>
          , <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/">MongoDB documentation</a>, and,
          of course, Stack Overflow.
        </p>

        <h2>Modifications and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          When building this app I chose to make several architectural changes
          from Subramanian&#39;s original. I&#39;ve documented the major
          modifications below.
        </p>

        <h3>Use of React Hooks instead of classes</h3>
        <p>
          Subramanian&#39;s code utilizes{' '}
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">
            React component classes
          </a>
          . When building my own app, I refactored all classes into more
          functional{' '}
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks</a>. I
          think the final result is more elegant and concise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to refactor the classes, I found I had to use these hooks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>useState</code> and <code>useReducer</code> manage state
            previously handled by <code>this.state</code>. Reducer was
            especially useful for complex state management, such as the{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker/ui/src/IssueEdit.jsx">
              IssueEdit
            </a>{' '}
            component that must fetch data, load data into form, track changes
            on form, and submit changes to API.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>useEffect</code> manages functions that need to opt into the
            component lifecycle. This was necessary where Subramanian used the
            class methods <code>componentDidMount</code>,{' '}
            <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and{' '}
            <code>componentWillUnmount</code>. For the{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker/ui/src/IssueTable.jsx">
              IssueTable
            </a>{' '}
            component, I found I needed to combine the side effect hook with a
            memoized callback (<code>useCallback</code>) to filter the table
            when the router parameters changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>useRef</code> allowed accessing child components in a form
            imperatively, such as in the{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker/ui/src/IssueAdd.jsx">
              IssueAdd
            </a>{' '}
            component where a form was referenced in order to access child input
            values.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Use of Material UI instead of Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>
          Subramanian made the case for Bootstrap over Material UI in his book:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Material UI has an interesting CSS-in-JS and inline-style approach
            of styling that fits well into Reactâ€™s philosophy of isolating
            everything needed by a component, with the component itself. But
            this framework is much less popular and seems to be a work in
            progress. And, perhaps the inline-style approach is too drastic a
            deviation from convention. React-Bootstrap is a safe alternative
            that is built on top of the very popular Bootstrap and fits our
            needs (except for the lack of a date picker).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Despite this sound argument, I went with Material UI because of
          curiosity and style preference. Having some experience with Bootstrap
          previously and keeping consistent with the goal of learning something
          new, I chose an alternate path. As I implement Material UI in this
          app, I want to test how easy it is to implement styled components into
          my React components, and how easy it is to implement my own custom
          styles to prevent the app design from looking bland and uniform.
