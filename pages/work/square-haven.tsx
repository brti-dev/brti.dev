          I cut my digital teeth on Square Haven. I learned digital technologies
          to express my interest in the videogames of the great RPG publisher,
          Squaresoft, creator of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series. It was my goal
          to create an online community for friends with the same passion.

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          A database of hundreds of games is maintained using PHP and MySQL.
          Each game has a hub page linking to relates modules -- news articles,
          videogame developers and creators, game guides, reader reviews, and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main features is a series of comprehensive game guides
          written in HTML or PHP backed by data. These features bring in the
          most traffic from search engines, often from users searching for
          hints, items, or quests as they play the game. Some of our top entry
          points on Google are:

          In <b>February 2020</b> I updated the backend PHP code to reflect the{' '}
          <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mysql_deprecation">deprecation</a>{' '}
          of the ancient <code>mysql_...</code> functions. Because the functions
          were so extensively used throughout the code, I opted to replace it
          with <code>mysqli_...</code> functions. At the same time, I updated
          the code to better secure the backend from SQL injection by using
          prepared statements and <code>mysqli_real_escape_string</code>.
